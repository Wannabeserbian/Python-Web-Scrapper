# Python-Web-Scrapper

A simple Web Scrapper built with Python

The script grabs a data table from a website and exports it to a CSV file 
In order to test it and play around with it you have to:

1) Install Python to your machine
2) Open command prompt in project direcory
3) Run the command at first: pip install requests bs4 (***Sorry I am a poor guy, I use Windows***)
4) After above is completed run the command: python webscrapper.py

That's it! Enjoy!
